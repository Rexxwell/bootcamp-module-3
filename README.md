# Module 3: Enums, Structs, Classes


In this module, we'll go over enums, structs, and classes.

## Getting Started

First, fork the repo into your own Github account and clone the forked
repo onto your local device.

Refer to [module 0](https://github.com/gtiosclub/bootcamp-module-0) for
instructions on how to do so.

Once you've cloned the repo, open the CarsApp project using Xcode if you
haven't already.

## TODO

Within CarsApp, go to the TODO folder and complete parts 1-3 based on the provided instructions. Complete the parts in the correct order, as the instructions are worded with that in mind.

Once you finish all parts, run the application using Cmd+R. The simulator takes a while to run, so don't worry if the simulator opens and is stuck with a blank screen. The blank screen will go away if you stay patient.

If any errors appear when attempting to run the app, it's probably because of one of the following reasons:
- You have a mistake in your code. Find it and fix it.
- You haven't selected the development account you will use for this project. If that's the case, go to folders and find the CarsApp directory at the top-most level (with an appstore logo beside it). Click on CarsApp under "Targets". Open the "Signing & Capabilities" tab. Next to "Team", select your account from the dropdown menu.
